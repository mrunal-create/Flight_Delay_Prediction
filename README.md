## OVERVIEW
Forecasting flight delays is a persistent challenge in the airline industry, where millions of flights generate massive datasets annually. Predicting these delays is critical for enhancing operational efficiency, improving customer experiences, and reducing financial losses. Traditional methods often fall short when faced with the sheer scale and complexity of such data, leading to slow and suboptimal predictions.
The U.S. Flight Delay Dataset presents a unique opportunity to address this issue, containing rich information such as departure and arrival airports, delay durations, and airline-specific data. However, the computational demands of analyzing and modeling these large datasets pose significant challenges, including:
Processing and transforming extensive data volumes in reasonable timeframes.
Training machine learning models efficiently without compromising accuracy.
The objective of this project is to leverage Apache Sparkâ€™s MLlib to harness the power of parallel computing for flight delay prediction. By distributing the workload across multiple processors, we aim to:
Reduce processing time for data transformations and model training.
Enhance the predictive accuracy of machine learning models through efficient parameter tuning.
Provide real-time delay predictions to support decision-making in the aviation industry.
This approach underscores the importance of distributed computing in solving data-intensive predictive tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution to a long-standing problem in aviation.
